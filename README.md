# WindowAndControlsDemo

Branches:

* master - default OS X skeleton app that other branches and tutorials are based off
* basic - adding some basic controls (a button and a label via textfield), along with very simple interactivity, see: http://kickcode.com/blog/2014/12/17/how-to-setup-and-position-basic-controls-in-a-mac-os-x-app-window-with-rubymotion.html
